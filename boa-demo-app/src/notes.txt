Module: Is a container to hold group of functions / classes
one module is one .js file  (minify) on demand (lazy loading)

savings.js
current.js
Home.js
FD.js

emp.js
export class EmpComponent{
    methdos

var x=10
var y=x // call by value
y=20
console.log(x) //10  immutable 

var ob1={x:10}     const store={} == state tree
var obj2=obj1;
obj2.x=20;
console.log(obj1.x) //20  call by ref

Object is mutable (Undo/ Redo)

obj2= Object.assign({},obj1)
obj2.x=20
obj1.x=10

obj2={...obj1} spread operator (ES6)

state ==Props  copy given {}

props are immutable  {x:10}
state is mutable

state tree + Component tree= DOM tree
ST + CT= DT
Redux + React = DT
React is View (MVC)
